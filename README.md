# apache-replay python package

## Summary

Many pieces of software exist that can take an existing Apache httpd (or other)
log in the Common Log format or Combined log format, parse them, and then do
something with them.   I find it convenient to be able to do this with pure
Python, though you will see a minor concession to logstash for the indexing of
the logs.

## Installation

pip install apache-replay
